                            The warmth of her wide smile and her utter unaffected nature distract all who meet Shiromal
                            Cooray as to what she really is: a leading figure in the travel industry who is prominently
                            placed amongst the 50 most powerful women of business in Sri Lanka and the highly efficient
                            and effective Chairman & Managing Director of Jetwing Travels: the main in-bound tour
                            operator arm of Jetwing.

                            As the daughter of Herbert Cooray – the founder and late Chairman of Jetwing, Shiromal was
                            in essence an heir to his legacy – but ever independent of spirit, she had no wish to be a
                            part of the family business and veered away from the leisure industry altogether to gain
                            qualifications in finance. Subsequently, she joined the vibrant world of advertising – as an
                            accountant at JWT, one of the leading ad agencies in Sri Lanka. Thriving in the fast paced,
                            exciting atmosphere, she handled both accounts and media, rising quickly to become the
                            Finance Director. When the opportunity arose to take up a similar post at JWT Hong Kong, she
                            was glad to broaden her career prospects in the region, gaining valuable experience.
                            <br><br>
                            Leaving advertising after 7 years, she returned to Sri Lanka and to the Jetwing family to
                            reinvent the travel division. The sector was increasing in scope in the early 90s and she
                            entered the challenge of growing the business with her usual resoluteness and foresight;
                            inspired and guided by her mentor and father. Over the years, Shiromal has steered the
                            company’s progress to the success it enjoys today, but in her unassuming manner regards
                            achievements as the norm, passing the credit on to the unstinted support of her team.
                            <br><br>
                            Deeply family oriented, Shiromal considers motherhood as possibly her greatest achievement.
                            While travel is her line of business, it is also a pastime she enjoys – especially voyages
                            of discovery to places that are off the everyday map. She loves to read – when time permits
                            and has a passionate interest in nature and the great outdoors.
                            <br><br>
                            A Fellow Member of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (UK), Shiromal also has
                            an MBA from (the University of Colombo). A dynamic presence in the corporate arena, she is
                            the former Vice-President of the Travel Agents Association of Sri Lanka (TAASL) and the
                            former President of the Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) - the
                            foremost representative body for tour operators in Sri Lanka. She was also elected recently
                            as the Chairperson of the Sri Lanka Institute of Directors (SLID).
                            <br><br>
                            As a director on the Board of Jetwing, she lends her invaluable support and insight to the
                            day to day operations of the group, but also extends her expertise to all Jetwing interests
                            that fall under the wing of travel. Shiromal is also a director at the advertising agency
                            Leo Burnett and the investment bank Capital Alliance and commodity broker Ceylon Tea
                            Brokers.
